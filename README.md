# ML_Digital_Signature

This project aims to test if it is possible to sign and verify using machine learning models to hash the input.

To execute the code, first run the key_generation file, and generate private and public keys.

Then you can run either Regular_Sign or Deep_Sign. The only thing to point out is that a file named "Capture.JPG" must be added in the same directory to sign and verify.
